 It looks like it's time to evacuate the major cities again because the King of the Monsters and the Eighth Wonder of the World are set to reunite for the next chapter of the MonsterVerse with Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire. Legendary's cinematic universe based on the legendary Toho monster films saw great success when the 2014 Godzilla film, functioning as a stellar western reboot that featured a jaw-dropping sense of scale and plenty of borderline apocalyptic monster fights. Soon after Godzilla defeated the fearsome MUTOs, audiences would also discover that Godzilla is not the only monster in the universe when Godzilla: King of the Monsters unleashed a slew of new threats onto the Earth. Though Godzilla very nearly meets his end at the claws of the deadly King Ghidorah, the mutated lizard king ultimately comes out on top takes claims the title of king for himself.

However, long before Godzilla became the ultimate monster in the world, there was another monster king who staked his claim on a secluded land called Skull Island. We see King Kong return to the filmmaking industry in a big way with Kong: Skull Island, showcasing the giant ape fighting off intruders in his sacred homeland. Decades later, Kong and Godzilla would come face to face in the appropriately titled Godzilla vs. Kong, and while they start out as ancient enemies, the two titans eventually team up to defeat the rogue Mecha-Godzilla. Now, Godzilla and Kong are set to reunite three years later with Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire. The next chapter of the MonsterVerse is bound to be an epic collection of chaos and mayhem, but the real question is whether the two titular monsters will once again be enemies or if they'll form a tepid alliance to take on a new threat. To learn more about the anticipated sequel's cast, trailer, release date, and more, here is everything we know so far about Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire.
